                          THE X-FILES
                   "Q-GUN – 波束射撃"

Teleplay by: YOUR NAME & ChatGPT
Draft date : 12 May 2025
Runtime    : ~45 min (Network Hour)

=================================================================

DEVICE DOSSIER — "Q-GUN Mark I"
Principle   : Fires a coherent matter-wave bullet that tunnels
              through up to 0.5 m of solid material, collapsing the
              wavefunction on the target.
Components  : Cryo-Emitter (-269 °C); Phase-Shift Crystal Array;
              Qubit Trigger Module.
Capabilities : Locked-room assassination; invisible entry;
              no ballistic trace.
Weakness    : Requires bulky cryo/power gear → detectable cold spot;
              EM jamming or random phase noise blocks collapse.

=================================================================

TEASER

INT. SECURE CONFERENCE ROOM – DAY
A group of OFFICIALS sits behind bulletproof glass walls. The room is
sealed. Suddenly, a faint *whoosh*. One official collapses, blood
issuing from his chest. No bullet hole in glass or walls.

SMASH TO:
MAIN TITLES

=================================================================

ACT ONE

INT. X-FILES OFFICE – DAY
Mulder reviews diplomatic cable on a locked-room killing. The
victim died inside a bulletproof-glass chamber built due to military
threat across the border.

                    SCULLY
          They say it was a heart attack.

                    MULDER
          But he bled from a single, precise entry wound… no exit.

Skinner enters, solemn.

                    SKINNER
          You’re heading to [Country]. Official stance: cardiac arrest.
          Unofficial: find the truth. Now.

=================================================================

ACT TWO

INT. FOREIGN POLICE HQ – EVENING
Photos of the sealed chamber. Witnesses insist they saw him
*suddenly* fall. Glass intact. No sound of gunfire.

                    INVESTIGATOR
          We screened for poison; none found. Only mystery remains.

Scully examines microscopic fragments: phase-interference fringes
indicating tunneled matter.

                    SCULLY
          These patterns match quantum tunneling signatures.

=================================================================

ACT THREE

INT. QUANTUMCORE R&D LAB – NIGHT
Lab filled with cryogenic equipment. A RECLUSIVE PHYSICIST, Dr.
YAMASHIRO, tinkers with crystal arrays.

                    MULDER
          Is this true? A gun that fires a wave?

                    YAMASHIRO (gravely)
          Wavepacket weapons are theoretical… dangerous.

A CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY (CS) AGENT appears:

                    CS AGENT
          Stop this. Leave the research alone.

He vanishes. Mulder pockets a smudged schematic labeled “Q-GUN.”

=================================================================

ACT FOUR

EXT. DARK ALLEY – LATE NIGHT
Mulder walks alone. A soft *hiss*. He clutches his chest as a wave
passes through brick. His coin-filled pocket stops him; the bullet
materializes against metal.

                    MULDER (staggering)
          It… it went through the wall, but not this.

Scully arrives, shining a UV light on lingering fringe patterns.

                    SCULLY
          It phases through insulators—glass, concrete—but not metal.

=================================================================

ACT FIVE

INT. X-FILES SAFEHOUSE – DAY
Mulder prepares to hand over files to diplomatic envoy via USB.
Suddenly, BLACK-CLAD AGENTS burst in, snatch the drive, and flee.
An empty folder remains labeled "Q-GUN Mark I."

                    MULDER
          They want to bury this.

                    SCULLY
          Officially: unexplained cardiac arrest.

=================================================================

TAG

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE – NIGHT
A FIGURE retrieves the stolen USB. On a laptop: folder named
"Q-GUN Mark II" appears. A blinking prompt: _"Ready to fire."_

FADE OUT.
