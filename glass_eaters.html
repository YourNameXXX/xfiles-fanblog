TEASER

EXT. MIAMI BEACH BOARDWALK – PRE‑DAWN AFTER A HURRICANE
Dark clouds still roil offshore. Emergency CREWS sweep debris.

A CITY WORKER (late‑20s) brushes a drift of BLACKISH SAND.

                    WORKER
          Nasty color for sand…

Suddenly the sand *flows* up a tempered‑glass HANDRAIL — the
panel hisses and disintegrates into powder. The worker SCREAMS
as the boardwalk lamp POST silently buckles.

WIDER: the façade of a NEARBY GLASS TOWER collapses in total
silence—every pane gone. Nature’s breath.

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:
                         MAIN TITLES

=================================================================

ACT ONE

INT. X‑FILES BASEMENT OFFICE – MORNING
Mulder finishes a slideshow: “Glassless high‑rises, fiber‑optic
blackouts, 17 Hz sonar pulse off Key Largo.”

                    MULDER
          All within twelve hours of Hurricane Reyna.

Scully side‑eyes a photo: ultraviolet close‑up of coral‑like
filigree on black sand.

                    SCULLY
          Coral patterns? In construction glass? 

Skinner enters, stern.

                    SKINNER
          Miami‑Dade wants answers before Spring Break. You’re on
          the next flight south.

CUT TO:

EXT. COLLAPSED HIGH‑RISE – DAY
Steel skeleton intact; lobby marble etched with MICRO‑GROOVES.
Mulder sprinkles sand under a UV wand — coral lattice fluoresces.

                    MULDER
          This isn’t erosion… it’s consumption.

Nearby, CITY ENGINEER reports plugs of shattered fiber conduit—
*optic cables dissolved from inside*.

=================================================================

ACT TWO

INT. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI MARINE LAB – NIGHT
Microscope view: fractal hexagons of SILICA. Scully annotates.

                    SCULLY (recorder)
          Synthetic codons in peptide hubs… someone printed these
          nano‑sponges.

Lab tech patches in live NOAA ROV feed—

EXT. ATLANTIC TRENCH – ROV CAM (MONITORS)
A milky “SAND‑FALL” pours into darkness. Sonar masks a VOID.

ROV audio crackles: a 17 Hz PULSE, like a distant heart.

Sudden STATIC. Feed dies. Fiber link *cut*.

=================================================================

ACT THREE

INT. MIAMI‑DADE EMERGENCY OPS CENTER – DAWN
Power grid failing. Mulder pitches *Operation GLASS BREAKER*.

                    MULDER
          Laser‑barges super‑heat the dunes, then Fire‑Rescue
          helicopters rain liquid nitrogen. Thermal shock will 
          pulverize the lattice.

Commissioners argue. A DHS SUIT drops a black folder:
“Unacknowledged Maritime Contact – Minimize Collateral”.

EXT. VIZCAYA GARDENS – AFTERNOON
Black sand flows like surf, climbing stained‑glass ORANGERIES.
Scully films MICRO video: sponges form translucent **EGGS** around
shards — deliberate harvesting.

                    SCULLY
          It’s not random. Someone’s gathering raw silica.

=================================================================

ACT FOUR – COUNTDOWN (LIVE CLOCK)

EXT. VIRGINIA KEY SHIPPING CHANNEL – DUSK
Two container CRANES retro‑fitted with 1.2 MW INDUSTRIAL LASERS.
Fire‑Rescue CH‑47s hover overhead, tanks of LN₂‑sea‑slurry.

00:05:00  – LASERS IGNITE. Dunes glow SCARLET.
00:04:00  – Black sand rears like a TSUNAMI, slamming the seawall.

INT. COMMAND BARGE
HUD shows surface temp 1250 °C. Mulder radios Scully in LH‑92.

                    MULDER
          Your turn to chill ‘em, Scully.

00:02:00  – Helos douse the dune. A piercing “CHIME.”
Sand turns to glittering POWDER, collapsing.

Suddenly all instruments spike—A MASSIVE SONAR SHADOW rises
beneath a CARGO SHIP, then vanishes. Low‑freq pulse FRIES boards.

=================================================================

ACT FIVE

INT. PORTMIAMI QUARANTINE HANGAR – MORNING
Buckets of inert WHITE POWDER. Scully: lattice fractured.

Coast Guard radar shows UNMARKED BARGE hauling crates offshore—
then blink **OFF SCOPE**.

INT. MIAMI INTL AIRPORT – EVENING
Mulder plays cleaned audio—prime number pulses. Timestamps MISS.

                    MULDER
          Someone scrubbed the source.

                    SCULLY
          Or… something.

=================================================================

TAG

EXT. MIAMI BEACH – NIGHT
A CHILD builds a sandcastle with leftover “snow.” Wind gust.
Camera PUSHES IN: within a turret, a TINY WEBBED FINGER twitches.
Castle collapses. Low sea‑rumble rolls across the beach.

                                                FADE OUT.
