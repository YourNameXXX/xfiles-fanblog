  <h2>CREATURE DOSSIER – "Killer Toast"</h2>
  <p><strong>Origin:</strong> In 1852 Virginia, a young African American slave woman was brutally whipped to death for dropping a piece of toast. Her vengeful spirit bound to every buttered slice.</p>
  <p><strong>Manifest:</strong> Buttered side down, with restless, malevolent agency.</p>
  <p><strong>Behavior:</strong> Leaps from plates at dawn, causing fatal slips or pushes victims off heights.</p>
  <p><strong>Weakness:</strong> Loses its power when buttered side lands up or on nonstick surfaces; spiritual pacification by apology rituals.</p>

<h2>TEASER</h2>
INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT – MORNING
A BUSINESSMAN butters toast, places it on a plate… a soft *slap* as the toast jumps off, landing butter-side DOWN. He bends to pick it up and slips off the balcony to his death.

SMASH TO:
MAIN TITLES

<h2>ACT ONE</h2>
INT. X-FILES OFFICE – DAY
Mulder holds a newspaper: “Three Mysterious Falls in Manhattan.”

  MULDER
  Notice each victim fell after breakfast.

SCULLY examines a buttered toast crumb under UV:

  SCULLY
  It glows… ash and linseed oil—centuries old.

Skinner enters:

  SKINNER
  Officially: accidental falls. But locals whisper "curse." Check it out.

<h2>ACT TWO</h2>
INT. UNIVERSITY LAB – EVENING
DR. AKARI YUUKI (20), MIT physicist prodigy, joins Scully. She sets up a pendulum and cites Buffon’s needle problem: statistical probability vs. curse.

  AKARI
  If buttered side down occurs 75% of the time, that’s a natural bias—not haunting.

SCULLY tastes buttered toast with stimulant test strips:

  SCULLY
  Trace of amphetamine—could be accidental contamination.

AKARI volunteers:

  AKARI
  I'll model toast flips in simulation. Science can explain this.

<h2>ACT THREE</h2>
INT. BAKERY – LATE NIGHT
Mulder and Scully confront the baker’s son, jittery and pale.

  BAKER’S SON
  I—I mixed some stimulants into the dough by accident! It's not supernatural,
  it's a production error!

He’s arrested, but dawn sees another fatal plunge. The curse persists.

<h2>ACT FOUR</h2>
EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACE – DAWN
Scully and Akari butter slices on both sides and distribute to townsfolk.
The toast lands harmlessly; nervous laughter.

INT. COMMUNITY HALL – MORNING
Mulder arranges an apology event with a local Black rights group. A reluctant MAYOR steps up.

  MULDER
  Today we acknowledge historic injustices to enslaved people.

  MAYOR
  I… apologize for my predecessors’ cruelty.

Outside, no falls occur.

<h2>ACT FIVE</h2>
INT. X-FILES OFFICE – NIGHT
Akari reviews simulation data:

  AKARI
  Even my model can’t account for the final falls—there’s a variable missing.

Mulder pins the 1852 clipping on the board.

  MULDER (smiling)
  Science isn't everything...

<h2>TAG</h2>
INT. X-FILES OFFICE – LATER
Scully pours cereal.

  SCULLY
  So… butter-up, every time.

Mulder gazes at the board, a nihilistic grin forming.

FADE OUT.
