CREATURE DOSSIER – "MYCEPHALUS GLACIALIS"
Origin   : Cryophilic parasitic fungus discovered only in Arctic
            permafrost cores; engineered by unknown party to enter
            human olfactory bulb.
Lifecycle: Infects host → compels host to bury self in permafrost
            3–4 yrs → resumes motor control → spreads spores in
            population centers.
Weakness : Severe heat (>42 °C) disrupts hyphal syncytium, but risks
            killing host.

TEASER

EXT. NORTH SLOPE, ALASKA – WINTER NIGHT
A lone arctic-researcher, DR. ERIKA VOSS, radios camp—static.
She steps into a self‑dug pit, burying herself alive. Close on
her eye: a FILAMENTOUS THREAD wriggles.

                                                    SMASH TO:
                         MAIN TITLES

===============================================================

ACT ONE

INT. X‑FILES OFFICE – MORNING
Mulder briefs Scully on four Nome residents missing for three
years who walked back into town hypothermic but alive. A CDC
physician who examined them is now dead. Skinner deploys them.

EXT. NOME MAIN STREET – DAY
A welcome parade. The returnees move stiffly; breath clouding
thick. A nearby CHILD coughs—white motes drift in sunlight.

===============================================================

ACT TWO

INT. NOME CLINIC – AUTOPSY ROOM – NIGHT
Scully opens the CDC doctor’s skull: BRAIN LACED WITH LUMINOUS
MYCELIUM. A probe touch and the corpse’s arm *jerks*.

EXT. PERMAFROST RIDGE – SAME
Mulder and a geologist use ground‑radar: dozens of HUMAN‑SHAPED
VOIDS beneath the ice.

===============================================================

ACT THREE

EXT. NOME AIRFIELD – DAWN
CH‑47 lands. COLONEL REEVES and Bio‑Hazard platoon impose
48‑hour quarantine—burn everything if no cure.

INT. SCHOOL GYM – MAKESHIFT LAB
Scully discovers the fungus carries edited telomerase genes—
crafted for longevity. She races to synthesize an antibody that
snips the “immortality switch.”

Meanwhile, RETURNED HOSTS attend a school assembly; HVAC blows
spores through vents—children collapse.

===============================================================

ACT FOUR – COUNTDOWN

00:04:00  – Reeves orders napalm line. Mulder warns about methane
             pockets; ignored.
00:02:00  – Scully injects EXPERIMENTAL ANTIBODY into infected boy.
             Flatline… then normal EEG. It works.
00:00:30  – Reeves raises detonator; Pentagon aborts strike on
             Mulder’s proof of cure.

===============================================================

ACT FIVE

INT. CARGO HELICOPTER – DAWN
Bio‑Hazard troopers load frozen hosts into crates—destination
CLASSIFIED. Mulder snaps photo; memory card instantly corrupts.

INT. X‑FILES OFFICE – NIGHT
Printer spits page: STATUS: NULL. Scully pockets leftover vial.

TAG

EXT. PERMAFROST RIDGE – MOONLIT NIGHT
Ice beneath drift pulses dim BLUE. Camera descends to a dormant
VOID; faint HEARTBEAT echoes. CUT TO BLACK.
