  <h2>TEASER</h2>
  <pre>
EXT. DESERT TOWN BARRECKS – DUSK
A MUMMIFIED MAN—draped in bandages—stumbles into a ramshackle encampment.
CITIZENS panic and flee.
Suddenly, a convoy of green-painted trucks with “EL-MAJID FREE STATE ARMY” markings screeches in.

TRUCK OFFICER (O.S.)
Everyone, stay calm. We’re here to protect you. Get aboard!

Villagers climb in. The Officer steps out,
glances once at the collapsed mummy, then climbs back in.
The convoy roars off into the dying light.
THEME MUSIC PLAYS.
  </pre>

  <h2>ACT ONE</h2>
  <pre>
INT. SECRET RESEARCH WAREHOUSE – NIGHT
CRATES upon crates hold dozens of bound mummies.
A LAB TECH in a white coat adjusts mysterious instruments.

GENERAL DICTATOR (O.S.)
Report.

He steps forward—regal, wrapped in ceremonial linens.

LAB TECH
We need more time. The neural implants haven’t stabilized.

DICTATOR
Then your daughters won’t need dinner tonight.

The Tech turns pale as the Dictator’s eyes glow beneath his hood.
  </pre>

  <pre>
INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS – X-FILES OFFICE – DAY
MULDER, SCULLY and SKINNER watch a live UN broadcast on human-rights abuses in El-Majid Free State.

SKINNER
Your assignment: we’re investigating those disappearances.

SCULLY
We’re… protecting human rights?

SKINNER
(gravely)
Orders from above. You leave tomorrow.
  </pre>

  <h2>ACT TWO</h2>
  <pre>
EXT. SECRET DESERT FACILITY – DAWN
Mulder and Scully arrive under cover of darkness.
They observe armed soldiers escorting a cage of elderly men into a hangar.
Inside, the Mummy(s) writhe in stasis chambers.

SCULLY
They’re using old men as test subjects… organ donors?

MULDER
Or worse. Testing immortality on the powerless.
  </pre>

  <h2>ACT THREE</h2>
  <pre>
INT. FACILITY LAB – LATER
Scully examines medical logs and autopsy photos.

SCULLY
No signs of trauma… but all victims show neural retrofit scars.

MULDER
They implant the dictator’s consciousness template—then dispose of the host.
Scully, they’ve made him more than a mummy: he’s become a networked ruler.
  </pre>

  <h2>ACT FOUR</h2>
  <pre>
INT. FACILITY CORRIDOR – NIGHT
They move to rescue one captive.

Suddenly, the DICTATOR emerges—his body flickers
in and out of phase, bending the corridor’s walls.

MULDER
He warps space… we can’t close on him!

SCULLY
(whispers into radio)
Backup—Green Berets only. Hurry!
  </pre>

  <pre>
EXT. DESERT HANGAR – MOMENTS LATER
A squad of GREEN BERETS storms in.
They confront the Dictator, but he phases through bullets, then vanishes.

SCULLY
He’s in their custody… or so we think.
  </pre>

  <h2>ACT FIVE</h2>
  <pre>
INT. X-FILES OFFICE – DAY
Mulder calls the Pentagon.

MULDER
Where is he?

TECH (V.O.)
We… have no record. He’s gone.

SCULLY
They quietly executed him, Mulder.

Mulder stares at the empty screen.

SCULLY (CONT’D)
Even tyrants have a finite lifespan—sunlight was his undoing.

MULDER
(softly)
…And the rest of us?
  </pre>

  <h2>EPILOGUE</h2>
  <pre>
EXT. VAST SAHARA – SUNSET
Two MEN IN BLACK watch the horizon.

BLACK SUIT #1
Another failure, I see.

BLACK SUIT #2
Don’t worry. Out in the Sahara… they’ll make it work eventually.

They share a knowing glance as the sun dips below the dunes.

SCULLY in office (V.O.)
If you can’t stand the sun… you can’t rule forever.

MULDER
But what if they find a way to outrun the sun?

FADE OUT.
